Welcome to sphiggy's documentation!
===================================


To make as few assumptions as possible is - among other - one motivation to use numerical methods in statistics. If you find some empirical distribution from your problem under consideration, you may be faced with the question how to use this distribution as a sampling engine. This is not too difficult, and we give an example here.

We have compiled two fast track guides
- one is :ref: 'written in MD (markdown)'<settingup>
- the other is written in RST (restructured text)
